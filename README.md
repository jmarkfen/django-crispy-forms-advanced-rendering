based on https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2018/11/28/advanced-form-rendering-with-django-crispy-forms.html

## Notes

For displaying forms:

    urls.py -> views.py -> forms.py

    * the html form fields are autogenerated from forms.py
    * form fields can be explicitly mentioned in the template (e.g. {{form.email}} )
